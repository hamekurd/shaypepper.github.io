This is my friend React web app. I decided to take a simple game i made in jQuery and format it for react/redux. Yes, I am well aware this is overkill.

## Rules
1. Each digit can only appear once in each column/row
2. The digits in any given group will give you the amount in the hint for that group when the operation in that hint is applied. Example: 45x as a hint for a two box group would mean 9 and 5 were in the two boxes. Order doesn't matter.
